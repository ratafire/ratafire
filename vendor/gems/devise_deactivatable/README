= devise_deactivatable

Super simple extension to allow accounts to be de-activated.

May only work on Rails 3, I've not tested any other versions, nor do
I have any intention of doing so.

Yes, it's almost the same thing as devise_suspendable, and I could
probably have used suspendable, but I enjoy re-inventing the wheel.
Suspendable also looks like it might not work with Devise 2, does
more than I want it to right now, and, call me picky but I think
this stuff matters, the name just doesn't match our terminology (we
talk about activating and de-activating accounts).

== Setup

You need to create a migration, manually (there is no magic here):

    class DeviseDeactivatableForUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
      def up
        add_column :users, :deactivated_at, :datetime
        add_index :users, :deactivated_at
      end
      def down
        remove_index :users, :deactivated_at
        remove_column :users, :deactivated_at
      end
    end

== Usage

Include in your model:

    devise ..., :deactivatable, ...

Receive three wonderful new methods, and modifications to two other methods:

   u = User.create(:name => 'Foo')
   u.deactivated? # false
   u.deactivate!
   u.deactivated? # true
   u.active_for_authentication? # false
   u.inactive_message # :deactivated
