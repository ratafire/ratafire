hello there

Creators and developers who are working on art, music, research or coding projects, for example, post about their projects on the site and define their current project and goals. Once a project has begun, the creator can invite subscribers to their project with a range of monthly support fees. While everyone can see the content, subscribers will get early access, and updates posted by the creator will appear on a subscriber's main feed. This allows the creator to receive ongoing support while subscribers can watch the progress of the projects they've selected.
