	<h1>FAQ</h1>

<h2>What is Ratafire’s licensing policy and why this license?</h2>

	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe that both creative or research works should be more open, and we think that the creators and researchers should be recognized and rewarded. Also, a more open environment can improve the quality of the work. We also believe that it is better for the public to see how the creators and researchers use the subscriptions they gain from Ratafire.</p>

	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Therefore, when you use Ratafire to share your projects, you are required to license the content you choose to post, except for software components, if any, under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.</p>

	<p id="faq-7472456" style="padding-left: 30px;">This means others can view and adapt your content, with your name properly attributed, but cannot use your content for commercial reasons without your permission.</p>

<h2>Can I still sell my works after I post them on Ratafire?</h2>

	<p id="faq-6469881" style="padding-left: 30px;">Yes. You have full commercial right to your content. You can further grant commercial licenses of your Content for a fee outside of Ratafire.</p>

<h2>Can I make my content fully open? Can I make my software open source?</h2>

	<p id="faq-5911545" style="padding-left: 30px;">Yes. On top of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>, you can add any additional licensing model you wish for the content you post.</p>

<h2>Why have monthly subscription fees instead of one-time pledges?</h2>
	
	<p id="faq-3863418" style="padding-left: 30px;">We believe that creators or researchers should be able to work on projects for the long term. Allowing ideas to mature over the long term can make a difference in the quality of the work.</p>

<h2>What features do subscribers receive?</h2>

	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you subscribe to a user, you will show up in the user’s Subscribers list, with the subscription length and amount. This list is public so your subscription is not anonymous.</p>

	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">In your <% if user_signed_in? %><%= link_to "Home", interesting_homepage_path(current_user), class:"no_ajaxify"%><% else %>Home<% end %> tab, you will see the updates from users you subscribe to, including the notifications of their new drafts. In this way, you will witness the creative process.</p>

	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">By subscribing, you can gain early access to major posts in projects that have the early access feature turned on. The maximum early access is 6 days.</p>

	<p id="faq-1287738" style="padding-left: 30px;">It is a benevolent act to support someone’s work on their creative or research project. We encourage you not only to subscribe, but also to subscribe to the best creators or researchers. By doing so, you \also take part in selecting the projects that get funded to completion.</p>

<h2>Why does Ratafire have price limits?</h2>

	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">We have six prices for subscription. Read our <%= link_to "Pricing", pricing_path, class:"no_ajaxify"%> page for details. The rationale behind it is that the lowest price cannot be too low, because art or research takes a great deal of time and effort. </p>

	<p id="faq-2347915" style="padding-left: 30px;">Our second concern is the highest price should not be too high, as it may lead to one creator or researcher being dependent on one subscriber, which can give the subscriber too much potential power over the content of the work.</p>

<h2>What are the differences between supporters and subscribers?</h2>

	<p id="faq-2348935" style="padding-left: 30px;">The supporter function is for you to try out Ratafire. Supporters will show up in the supporters tab instead of the subscriber tab. Supporters will not get an update stream of the user they support. To use the main subscription function, after you have used all your supporter trials, select subscription.</p>

<h2>How do I get more supporter slots?</h2>

	<p id="faq-7350619" style="padding-left: 30px;">You initially have 5 supporter slots, with which you can use to support 5 users. If you use up your supporter slots, the number of users you subscribe to will determine the supporter slots you have. For example, if you subscribe to one user, you will have additional 5 supporter slots to spend after the monthly billing has taken place, which means you can then support 5 more users. </p>	

<h2>Why can’t I limit previews of my content if someone is subscribing to me?</h2>

	<p id="faq-7510653" style="padding-left: 30px;">First it violates our <%= link_to "Terms of Use", terms_path, class:"no_ajaxify"%>, but more importantly, since your subscribers subscribed to you with monthly subscription fees, you should maintain your update frequency for the purpose of transparency.</p>

<h2>Why do I have to wait for 30 days before subscribing to the same user again?</h2>

	<p id="faq-2310305" style="padding-left: 30px;">This policy is designed for anti-spam purposes. Think carefully before you subscribe.</p>

<h2>Why can’t I subscribe to someone who has met his or her subscription goal?</h2>

	<p id="faq-8186171" style="padding-left: 30px;"><b></b>Creators or researchers have the responsibility to set a funding goal for their project. If they decide more funds are needed, they can increase their goal.</p>

<h2>Can non-subscribers see all projects?</h2>

	<p id="faq-3757353" style="padding-left: 30px;">Yes. Subscription does not grant the subscribers exclusive access to content, but subscribers will see your updates on their main feed.</p>

<h2>Can people living outside of the US subscribe or receive subscriptions on Ratafire?</h2>

	<p id="faq-3757352" style="padding-left: 30px;">Currently, anyone can subscribe to users on Ratafire, but only people living in the United States can receive monthly subscription amounts.</p>	

<h2>I want to work at Ratafire! What should I do?</h2>

	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Good question. If you are a developer, you know the usual stuff: give us your Github account or Stackoverflow account or show us the best thing you have built. If you are neither a developer nor a designer, read <%= link_to "The Mythical Man-Month", "https://archive.org/details/mythicalmanmonth00fred", class:"no_ajaxify", target:"_blank"%>; give us your comments on it and tell us whatbooks you read last year.</p>

	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">But this isjust the usual stuff. If you have something you want to build on Ratafire, tell us. If it is great, you will be able to work on your own ideas in Ratafire, as long as they fit Ratafire’s goal.</p>
